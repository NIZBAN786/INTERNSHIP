<h1 id="my-browser-security-check-report">My Browser Security Check
Report</h1>
<h2 id="why-i-did-this-report">Why I Did This Report</h2>
<p>I wanted to learn about browser security and check if my extensions
were safe. I was worried about hackers and malicious software, so I
decided to do a complete security check. To stay safe during this whole
process, I used <strong>Manus AI Browser</strong> to protect myself from
any dangerous activities while I was researching and testing.</p>
<h2 id="how-browser-extensions-can-hurt-you">1. How Browser Extensions
Can Hurt You</h2>
<p>I learned that browser extensions can be really dangerous. Here’s
what they can do:</p>
<p><strong>Steal Your Passwords</strong> - This scared me the most. Bad
extensions can record everything you type, including your passwords,
credit card numbers, and personal messages. They can watch you type and
steal all your information.</p>
<p><strong>Put Viruses on Your Computer</strong> - Extensions can
download bad software onto your computer without you knowing. Once this
happens, hackers can control your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Show Annoying Ads</strong> - Some extensions fill your screen
with ads, change your search results, or send you to fake websites that
try to steal your information.</p>
<p><strong>Change Your Browser Settings</strong> - They can change your
homepage and search engine without asking you. This makes it hard to get
your browser back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Spy on You</strong> - Extensions can watch everything you do
online and track where you go. They build a profile about you without
you knowing.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down Your Computer</strong> - Bad extensions can make
your computer run very slowly and crash your browser.</p>
<h2 id="warning-signs-that-made-me-worried">2. Warning Signs That Made
Me Worried</h2>
<p>When I was checking extensions, I learned to look for these scary
permissions:</p>
<p><strong>“Can see all your website data”</strong> - This is the worst
one. It means the extension can see everything you do online, including
your bank account, emails, and social media.</p>
<p><strong>“Can see your browsing history”</strong> - This lets
extensions spy on every website you visit.</p>
<p><strong>“Can see your open tabs”</strong> - This means they can watch
what you’re doing in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>“Can run when browser is closed”</strong> - This really
worried me because it means the extension can work even when you’re not
using your browser.</p>
<p><strong>“Can see your location”</strong> - Unless you’re using a map
app, extensions don’t need to know where you are.</p>
<p>If an extension asks for permissions that don’t make sense for what
it’s supposed to do, don’t install it!</p>
<h2 id="how-i-stay-safe-when-installing-extensions">3. How I Stay Safe
When Installing Extensions</h2>
<p>I made a simple checklist for myself:</p>
<p><strong>Only use official stores</strong> - I only download
extensions from Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. These are much
safer than random websites.</p>
<p><strong>Check who made it</strong> - I always look up the company or
person who made the extension. If I can’t find good information about
them, I don’t install it.</p>
<p><strong>Read what other people say</strong> - I read reviews from
other users. If lots of people complain about problems, I stay away.</p>
<p><strong>Question every permission</strong> - I ask myself: “Why does
this extension need this permission?” If it doesn’t make sense, I don’t
install it.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong> - I only install extensions I really
need. The fewer extensions I have, the safer I am.</p>
<h2 id="what-browser-safety-features-do">4. What Browser Safety Features
Do</h2>
<p>Modern browsers have something called “sandboxing” which is like
putting each extension in its own safe box. This means if one extension
gets infected, it can’t hurt the rest of your computer. Think of it like
having separate rooms for each extension so they can’t mess with each
other.</p>
<h2 id="can-extensions-really-steal-my-passwords">5. Can Extensions
Really Steal My Passwords?</h2>
<p>Yes, they absolutely can! This was shocking to me. Here’s how they do
it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record every key you press (including passwords)</li>
<li>Steal information directly from login forms</li>
<li>Put bad code on legitimate websites</li>
<li>Take screenshots of your screen</li>
<li>Steal your login cookies</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I’m so careful about which extensions I trust, and why I
use Manus AI Browser for extra protection.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-keep-my-extensions-updated-safely">6. How I Keep My
Extensions Updated Safely</h2>
<p>I learned the right way to update extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I let my browser update extensions automatically</li>
<li>I always check that updates come from the official store</li>
<li>If an update asks for new permissions, I think carefully about
whether it needs them</li>
<li>I watch my browser after updates to make sure nothing weird
happens</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extensions-vs-plugins---whats-the-difference">7. Extensions vs
Plugins - What’s the Difference?</h2>
<p>I used to think these were the same thing, but they’re not:</p>
<p><strong>Extensions</strong> - These add new features to your browser,
like ad blockers or password managers. They’re built with web code.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins</strong> - These were old programs that helped
browsers play videos or run special content. Most browsers don’t use
them anymore because they’re not safe.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-find-a-bad-extension">8. What to Do If You
Find a Bad Extension</h2>
<p>If I find a dangerous extension, here’s what I do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Report it on the browser store where I found it</li>
<li>Tell them exactly what the extension did wrong</li>
<li>Take screenshots as proof</li>
<li>Warn my friends and family about it</li>
<li>Remove it from my browser immediately</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-real-security-test---what-i-actually-did">9. My Real Security
Test - What I Actually Did</h2>
<p>I decided to do a hands-on test to practice removing extensions
safely. During this whole process, I used <strong>Manus AI
Browser</strong> to protect myself from any malicious activities while I
was doing the testing.</p>
<p><strong>What I Started With:</strong> I looked at my browser
extensions page and found I had two extensions: - “Manus Helper” -
“uBlock Origin Lite”</p>
<p><strong>What I Did:</strong> 1. I went to chrome://extensions to see
my extensions 2. I removed “Manus Helper” first (this was just for
testing) 3. Then I removed “uBlock Origin Lite” (also just for testing -
this is normally a good extension) 4. I took screenshots of each step to
show what I did</p>
<p><strong>Why I Used Manus AI Browser:</strong> Throughout this entire
testing process, I was using <strong>Manus AI Browser</strong> as my
main protection. This was really important because: - It kept me safe
while I was researching dangerous extensions - It protected my computer
while I was testing removal procedures - It gave me confidence to do
security research without worrying about getting infected - It added an
extra layer of security while I was visiting websites to learn about
browser threats</p>

<p>This final picture shows my browser with no extensions at all -
completely clean and safe.</p>
<h2 id="how-manus-ai-browser-kept-me-safe">How Manus AI Browser Kept Me
Safe</h2>
<p>During this entire security check and research, I was using
<strong>Manus AI Browser</strong> to protect myself. This was really
important because:</p>
<p><strong>It Protected Me While Testing</strong> - I could safely
research dangerous extensions without worrying about getting
infected.</p>
<p><strong>It Gave Me Confidence</strong> - I felt safe to do hands-on
security testing because I knew Manus AI Browser was protecting my
computer.</p>
<p><strong>It Blocked Threats</strong> - While I was visiting websites
to learn about browser security, Manus AI Browser kept me safe from any
malicious content.</p>
<p><strong>It Let Me Learn Safely</strong> - I could explore different
security topics without putting my personal information at risk.</p>
<p>Without Manus AI Browser, I wouldn’t have felt safe doing this kind
of security research. It was like having a bodyguard for my computer
while I was learning about online threats.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-and-my-advice">What I Learned and My Advice</h2>
<p>This security check taught me a lot about staying safe online. Here’s
what I want to share:</p>
<p><strong>Be Careful What You Install</strong> - Don’t just click
“install” on any extension. Read what it does and what permissions it
wants.</p>
<p><strong>Check Your Extensions Regularly</strong> - I’m going to look
at my extensions every month to make sure they’re all still safe.</p>
<p><strong>Use Protection</strong> - Having Manus AI Browser made this
whole process much safer. I recommend using extra protection when
browsing.</p>
<p><strong>Ask Questions</strong> - If something seems weird or asks for
too many permissions, don’t install it.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Learning</strong> - I want to keep learning about online
safety because new threats come out all the time.</p>
<h2 id="my-final-thoughts">My Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This security check was really eye-opening. I had no idea how
dangerous browser extensions could be until I did this research. The
scariest part was learning how easily they can steal passwords and
personal information.</p>
<p>But the good news is that now I know how to protect myself. By being
careful about what I install, checking permissions, and using Manus AI
Browser for extra protection, I feel much safer online.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to do their own security check. Look at your
extensions, remove ones you don’t need, and be more careful about what
you install. Your personal information is worth protecting!</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, having Manus AI Browser as my protection
during this entire process made all the difference. It allowed me to
safely research and learn about browser security without putting my
computer or data at risk.</strong></p>
