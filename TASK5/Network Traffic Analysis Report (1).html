<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This report provides an analysis of the network traffic captured in
  the <code>TASK5.pcap</code> and <code>task5.pcapng</code> files. The
  analysis aims to identify the types of protocols present, common network
  conversations, and potential security-related anomalies, following a
  structure similar to the provided example report.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the protocol distribution observed in
  the <code>TASK5.pcap</code> file:</p>

===================================================================</code></pre>
<p>From the protocol hierarchy of <code>TASK5.pcap</code>, it is evident
  that the file exclusively contains ICMP traffic encapsulated within IP
  and Ethernet frames. This indicates that this capture primarily consists
  of ICMP-based communications, most likely from ping operations.</p>

<p>The <code>task5.pcapng</code> file shows a more diverse protocol
  hierarchy compared to <code>TASK5.pcap</code>. While ICMP traffic still
  constitutes a significant portion of the IPv4 traffic, likely indicating
  ping activities, MDNS (Multicast DNS) is also present within both IPv4
  and IPv6 UDP traffic. Additionally, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
  traffic is observed. This suggests that <code>task5.pcapng</code>
  captures a broader range of network activities, including service
  discovery and address resolution, in addition to basic connectivity
  checks.</p>

================================================================================</code></pre>
<p>The conversation between <code>172.24.78.124</code> and
  <code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google DNS) is the sole and most prominent
  conversation in <code>TASK5.pcap</code>, accounting for all observed
  ICMP packets. This strongly suggests that <code>172.24.78.124</code> is
  initiating ping requests to <code>8.8.8.8</code>, and
  <code>8.8.8.8</code> is responding. This is consistent with the protocol
  hierarchy analysis, which showed only ICMP traffic in this file.

<p>In <code>task5.pcapng</code>, the conversation between
  <code>172.24.78.124</code> and <code>8.8.8.8</code> remains the most
  prominent, similar to <code>TASK5.pcap</code>. Additionally, there is a
  conversation involving <code>172.24.64.1</code> and the multicast
  address <code>224.0.0.251</code>, which is characteristic of MDNS
  traffic. This further supports the observation of MDNS in the protocol
  hierarchy of <code>task5.pcapng</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="tcp-conversation-analysis">TCP Conversation Analysis</h2>
<p>No TCP conversations were identified in either
  <code>TASK5.pcap</code> or <code>task5.pcapng</code>. This suggests that
  during the capture period, there was no significant TCP-based
  application-layer communication such as web browsing, file transfers, or
  other TCP-heavy activities. The example report showed TCP traffic,
  indicating that the original <code>Taskk5.pcap</code> file it was based
  on contained such traffic, which is not present in the provided PCAP
  files.
</p>
<h2 id="security-findings-and-observations">Security Findings and
  Observations</h2>
<p>Based on the analyzed traffic in <code>TASK5.pcap</code> and
  <code>task5.pcapng</code>, the following security-related observations
  can be made:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exclusive ICMP Traffic in
        <code>TASK5.pcap</code></strong>: <code>TASK5.pcap</code> contains only
      ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply messages. This narrow scope of traffic
      suggests a specific purpose, such as network connectivity testing or
      monitoring, rather than general network activity. No other protocols
      were observed, limiting the scope of security analysis to only
      ICMP-based threats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Symmetric ICMP Communication</strong>: In both
      <code>TASK5.pcap</code> and <code>task5.pcapng</code>, the ICMP
      communication between <code>172.24.78.124</code> and
      <code>8.8.8.8</code> is symmetric, with an equal number of Echo Requests
      and Echo Replies. This indicates normal, healthy communication without
      significant packet loss or one-way communication issues, which could
      otherwise suggest network problems or certain types of attacks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No Unusual ICMP Types/Codes</strong>: Only standard ICMP
      Type 8 (Echo Request) and Type 0 (Echo Reply) with Code 0 were observed
      in both files. The absence of other ICMP types (e.g., Destination
      Unreachable, Time Exceeded) or unusual codes suggests no apparent
      network errors or attempts to exploit ICMP for information gathering or
      attacks (like ICMP floods with unusual types).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No Ping Flood Indication</strong>: The volume of ICMP
      traffic in both files is not indicative of a ping flood attack. A ping
      flood typically involves a significantly higher volume of requests aimed
      at overwhelming a target. The observed volume is consistent with routine
      connectivity checks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MDNS and ARP Traffic in
        <code>task5.pcapng</code></strong>: The presence of MDNS (Multicast DNS)
      and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) traffic in
      <code>task5.pcapng</code> is common in local networks for device and
      service discovery and address resolution. While generally benign, these
      protocols can sometimes be exploited for amplification attacks or
      information gathering in vulnerable configurations. However, no
      immediate vulnerabilities were identified in this capture. The example
      report also noted MDNS and SSDP traffic, aligning with the observations
      in <code>task5.pcapng</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Absence of TCP Activity</strong>: Unlike the example
      report, neither of the provided PCAP files (<code>TASK5.pcap</code> or
      <code>task5.pcapng</code>) contained any TCP conversations. This means
      there were no observed web browsing, file transfers, or other TCP-heavy
      applications during these capture periods. Therefore, no analysis of TCP
      flag sequences or potential TCP-based attacks (like port scanning or
      denial-of-service attempts via TCP) could be performed based on these
      files.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Absence of Alarming Signatures</strong>: Based on the
      high-level analysis of protocols and conversations in both
      <code>TASK5.pcap</code> and <code>task5.pcapng</code>, there were no
      obvious signs of common network attacks such as widespread port scanning
      (many SYN packets without corresponding ACKs), brute-force attempts, or
      known malware communication patterns. However, this does not rule out
      more sophisticated or encrypted threats that might not be visible at
      this level of analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis of <code>TASK5.pcap</code> and
  <code>task5.pcapng</code>, the network traffic primarily consists of
  ICMP, MDNS, and ARP protocols. <code>TASK5.pcap</code> is exclusively
  ICMP traffic, while <code>task5.pcapng</code> shows a broader range
  including MDNS and ARP, indicating regular network operations, including
  connectivity checks, local service discovery, and address resolution. No
  TCP activity was observed in either file, which differs from the example
  report. While no immediate security threats or anomalies were identified
  through this high-level analysis, a more in-depth inspection of
  application-layer data (if available and unencrypted) would be necessary
  for a comprehensive security assessment. This report provides a
  foundational understanding of the network behavior captured in the
  provided PCAP files.
